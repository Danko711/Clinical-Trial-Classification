      The primary objectives of this study are:

      Phase 1: To evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with utomilumab and
      to identify the most appropriate dose and timing of utomilumab to carry forward into Phase 2

      Phase 2: To evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel and utomilumab in participants
      with refractory large B-cell lymphoma
